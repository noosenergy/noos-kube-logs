# Noos Kube Logs
Logs monitoring boilerplate for the Noos platform.

This project regroups quite a few ideas gathered along blogs, threads, repositories and other documentations. To give back to the community, Noos Energy open-sourced the deployment of such a service to help other developpers to jump-start building their cloud-native infrastructure.

## Quickstart

### Kubernetes and Helm installation

On Mac OSX, make sure [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) has been pre-configured, then install Kubernetes and Helm CLI,

    $ brew install awscli kubectl helm

### Local development

The development workflows of this project can be managed by [noos-invoke](https://github.com/noosenergy/noos-invoke), a ready-made CLI for common CI/CD tasks.

``` shell
